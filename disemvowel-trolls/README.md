## Problem domain
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata *y* isn't considered a vowel.

## Solution:
1. Write a function that will look for vowels and remove them
2. Using regex syntax, look for a, e, i, o, u letters and remove them
3. Use gi at the end of the regex to look globally (at each letter) and to be case-insensitive
