## Problem domain
Use map() to double the values in an array

Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object.

For example: var someNumbers = [1,2,10,57]; double(someNumbers); // should return [2,4,20,114]

## Solution:
	1. Write a function that takes in array
	2. Return the array with the map method
	3. In the map method, write a function that will multiple each number by 2
	4. This will return an array of numbers that are double their original value
