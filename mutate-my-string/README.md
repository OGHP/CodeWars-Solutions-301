## Problem domain
I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.

## Solution:
1. turn each string into individual letters
2. create an empty array to hold the new strings
3. loop through each string of individual letters
4. check if they are looking at the same letter,
  if so...
5. make stringOne[i] become stringTwo[i] with a loop
6. create a new line each time
